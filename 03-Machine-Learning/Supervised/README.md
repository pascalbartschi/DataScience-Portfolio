## Description

Here, you find a collection of script representing my experience in analysing data with supervised learning.

## Contents:
* [Deep Learning Image Classification](DL-image-classification.ipynb): In this notebook we use PyTorch to classify images from the [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) and [CIFAR10](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10) dataset.
* [Random Forrest classification](forrest-wine-classification.ipynb) Wine is classified by using the Decision Tree and Random Forrest algorithm.
* [Signal-classification](multivariate-signal-classification.ipynb) Multivariate classificatication with the BDT algorithm (Boosted Decision Tree) and feature selection by rectangular selection.
* [KNN & SVM](KNN+SVM-classification-IRIS.ipynb) Comparing the performance of KNN and SVM classification of the iris dataset.
* [Logistic & LDA](logistic+LDA-classification.ipynb): Classifying flower species of the iris dataset with the logistic classification and linear discriminant analysis
