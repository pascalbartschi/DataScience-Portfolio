## Description

Here, you find a collection of script representing my experience in analysing data with supervised learning.

## Contents:
* [Predicting Product Review Scores Using Transformers](Review-Scores-with-Transformers): This project involves predicting product review scores from text using transformer models like DistilBERT, focusing on extracting embeddings to infer a continuous score between 0 and 10.
* [Taste Similarity Prediction Using Food Image Analysis with Transfer Learning](Taste-Similarity-Transfer-Learning/): This project uses a supervised learning approach with transfer learning to predict food taste similarity from images based on human-annotated triplet comparisons.
* [Electricity Price Prediction CH](Electricity-Price-Prediction-CH/): This project predicts electricity prices in Switzerland using kernel regression, focusing on data preprocessing, kernel selection, and model tuning to handle challenges like missing data and low predictivity.
* [Deep Learning Image Classification](DL-image-classification.ipynb): In this notebook we use PyTorch to classify images from the [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist) and [CIFAR10](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10) dataset.
* [Random Forrest classification](forrest-wine-classification.ipynb) Wine is classified by using the Decision Tree and Random Forrest algorithm.
* [Signal-classification](multivariate-signal-classification.ipynb) Multivariate classificatication with the BDT algorithm (Boosted Decision Tree) and feature selection by rectangular selection.
* [KNN & SVM](KNN+SVM-classification-IRIS.ipynb) Comparing the performance of KNN and SVM classification of the iris dataset.
* [Logistic & LDA](logistic+LDA-classification.ipynb): Classifying flower species of the iris dataset with the logistic classification and linear discriminant analysis
