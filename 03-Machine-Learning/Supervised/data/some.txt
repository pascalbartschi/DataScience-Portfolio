The autumnal reaper The stains of this creeper Will last, the shine and the sham entangled Like salting earth with tears of Jesus He sliced and diced our dreams to pieces For the dreams that you dread Can become just as real As the blood that was shed With the slash of his steel Now the street walking dead Was quite a scene, wasn't it? For the lost and misled Were promised seats by the pit We will break away together I'll be the shadow You'll be the light Nothing ever lasts forever We will go softly into the night We're leaving this city So this is farewell Goodbye seven sisters And Saint Jezebel The moon in the gutter Has a story to tell One day he will come back From the bowels of hell He appeared to ascend So we all stood there in awe Now we have to pretend We didn't see what we saw With the curtain unveiled To the sound of applause That the king that we hailed Was the wizard of Oz We will break away together I'll be the shadow You'll be the light Nothing ever lasts forever We will go softly into the night Nothing ever lasts forever We will go softly into the night
