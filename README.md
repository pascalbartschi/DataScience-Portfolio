### Concepts in data analysis 
I collected scipts containing concepts and approaches to analysise data in diverse ways and developed them to be better documented and more presentable. The idea is to one day narrow the information further down to have a portfolio :)

### Directories

* 00-data: mostly dataframes to analyse
* 01-data-exploration: scripts for Exploratory Data Analys
* 02-statistical-analysis-modelling: to be finished documenting
* 03-machine-learning: tbd
* 04-numerical-optimmization: tbd
* 05-time-series: tbd
