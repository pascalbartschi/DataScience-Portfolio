### Description
I collected scipts containing concepts and approaches to analysise data in diverse ways and developed them to be better documented and more presentable. The idea is to one day narrow this code further down to have put together a portfolio. 

### About

* [01-Exploratory-Data-Analysis](01-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/): quick and dirty analysis of data finding simple relationships, distributions or missing values in data
* [02-Statistical-Analysis](02-Statistical-Analysis): Covers the following approaches to analyse pattern and relationships in data:
   - [Hypothesis-Testing](02-Statistical-Analysis/Hypothesis-Testing)
   - Probability Distributions
   - Regression
   - Uncertainty
   - Regression
   - Model selection

### Directions

01 and 02 are appropriately documeneted, 03 is in development and I'm still integrating files from other problem I solved
