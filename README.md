### Description
I collected scripts containing concepts and approaches to analysise data in diverse ways and developed them to be better documented and more presentable. The idea is to one day narrow this code further down to have put together a portfolio.

### About

* [01-Exploratory-Data-Analysis](01-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/): quick and dirty analysis of data finding simple relationships, distributions or missing values in data
* [02-Statistical-Analysis](02-Statistical-Analysis/): Covers the following approaches to analyse pattern and relationships in data:
  - [Hypothesis-Testing](02-Statistical-Analysis/Hypothesis-Testing/): Includes Analysis of Variance ([ANOVA](02-Statistical-Analysis/Hypothesis-Testing/ANOVA/)), Analysis of Covariance ([ANCOVA](02-Statistical-Analysis/Hypothesis-Testing/ANCOVA/)) and [Chi-Squared Testing](02-Statistical-Analysis/Hypothesis-Testing/Chi-Squared/)
  - [Probaility and Likelihood](02-Statistical-Analysis/Probability+Likelihood/): Explore scripts that deal with various probability distributions commonly used in statistical analysis, as well as the self implemented MLE approach to fit parameters.
  - [Regression Model](02-Statistical-Analysis/Regression-Models/): Discover scripts performing regression analysis to model relationships between variables with [linear and multiple regression](02-Statistical-Analysis/Regression-Models/linear-regression), [GLMS or LMMs](02-Statistical-Analysis/Regression-Models/glm+lmm) and optimzinhg anaylsis with [model selection](02-Statistical-Analysis/Regression-Models/model-selection)
  - [Time Series](02-Statistical-Analysis/Time-Series/):  A script analysing components and stationarity of time series data of air travel.
  - [Uncertainty Analysis](02-Statistical-Analysis/Uncertainty-Analysis/): Learn about how to handle uncertainty in [fitting](02-Statistical-Analysis/Uncertainty-Analysis/LS_fitting_respecting_uncertainty.ipynb) or [error propagation](02-Statistical-Analysis/Uncertainty-Analysis/error-propagation.ipynb).
* [03-Machine-Learning](03-Machine-Learning): Represents my experience in analysing data with ML by:
  - [Supervised Learning](03-Machine-Learning/Supervised): Discover scripts using [Deep Learning](03-Machine-Learning/Supervised/DL-image-classification.ipynb) and other classification approaches like [KNN, SVM](03-Machine-Learning/Supervised/KNN+SVM-classification-IRIS.ipynb) or [BDT](03-Machine-Learning/Supervised/multivariate-signal-classification.ipynb).
  - [Unsupervised Learning](dummy) In development...

### Directions

I'm currently documenting further analyses for the directory Machine Learning.
