# Probability and Likelihood

This directory contain analyses of data by considering underlying probability distributions or using likehood for parameter fitting.

## Content:

* **fitting-data-with-MLE**: This script uses NLL in MLE to find the parameters of distributions data is assumed to be generated from, as well as binning the data and fitting it to a polynomial of unknown degree.
* **KDE-Gridsearch**: Short script performing Gridsearch to find the optimal bandwidth for a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)
* **particle-detection-efficiency**: Predicting detection efficiency using the Poisson and Normal distributions.
