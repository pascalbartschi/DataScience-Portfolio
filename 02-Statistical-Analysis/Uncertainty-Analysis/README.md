## Description

Here, you can find approaches to analyse how uncertainty in data propagates or affects results of fitting.

## Contents

* [LS-uncertainty](LS_fitting_respecting_uncertainty.ipynb): In this script the effect constant vs. varying uncertainties on least-squared fitting is explored
* [Error Propagation](error-propagation.ipynb): Short code exploring how error propagation can be esimated by respecting correlation.
